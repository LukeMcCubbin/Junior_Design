//In this code outline I am going to make an outline of how I think the code should run.
// I will appreaciate any aditional comments or changes

process state = manual hand loading into conveyor


//pseudo code

- Initialize things
	*stepperUp, left, right
	*DCmotor
	*2 sensors
	*LCD

	//What else do I need pins for?


-functions:
	- processblock: process state
		(waits for 2 seconds)
		(runs DC motor for 1)
		(sensor == 1 then countblock++)
		(when countbock = randnum -1) got to state prevNum

	- loadblock: loading state
		(runs until sensor == 1)
		(waits for cooridnate system to finish loading)
		(runs for 2 seconds or sensor == 1)
		(countblock --)
      
	- lower_level:
		(step block down 1 second)
		(wait)
		return state +1;
	- Unload 
		wait 


-Always loops
during always while loop: check unputs(buttons)

	- required conditions while STOP_button !=1,
	- if  



-States: {

	default(bottom left) 

	1: (load position top left level up)
		- stepper up 1 second, 3*200 rotations?
		- call loadblock
		- call lower_level

	2: (load position top left level down)
		(also the default state)
		- call loadblock

	3:(load position top right level up)
		-stepper left, right move;
		-stepper up 1 second
		-call loadblock
		-call lower_level

	4:(load position top right level down)
		-call loadblock

	5:(load position bottom right level up)
		-stepper left, right move;
		-stepper up 1 second
		-call loadblock
		-call lower_level

	6:(load position bottom right level down)
		-call loadblock
	
	7:(load position bottom left level up)
		-stepper left, right move;
		-stepper up 1 second
		-call loadblock
		-call lower_level

	8:(load position bottom left level down)
		-call loadblock
		- Done call unload 
		- move left right (return to default)
